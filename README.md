# LAB_6.2_ABtesting
create a readme file in your lab repo which summarises the scenario, and initial visual findings 
CASE SCENARIO: 
The company I work for as a junior analyst carried out an AB test on the website the clients use to register.
The AB test consists of the comparison of two versions of the website (one control and one experimental version) that thousands of users utilized. The experimental version implements a more modern UI.

Measurment period: 3/15/2017 â€“ 4/30/2017

Files provided:
1. user_id with type of version used
2. demographic of the users
3. results


OBJECTIVES:
- How do the clients interact with the new product compared to the control version?
- What is the impact of the new product?

Pre-objectives: are there any initial demographic differences between the control and the experimental group?

The graph shows that the first and the last steps are the two obstacles of the control version: here the churn rate is much higher than in the experimental version:

THE EXPERIMENTAL VERSION IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER!
